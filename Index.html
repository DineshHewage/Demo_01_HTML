                <h3>The importency of sustainablity</h3>
                Research shows that 62% of Gen-Z shoppers prefer to buy from sustainable brands, 
                and 73% will pay a premium for sustainable products. According to the National Retail Federation, between half to two-thirds of shoppers overall 
                would pay more for sustainable products. That said, the urgency to be more sustainable not only has powerful ramifications for brands’ bottom lines, 
                but it’s now also becoming a matter of law.</p>
